## Preface

There are plenty of ways when it comes to bundle size and increasing performance of a react application.
When using Nextjs, a simple way to do this is by replacing react with preact in the production build.

<br/>

But a word of caution at this point. Preact is a slimmed down version of react, with less features like:

<br/>

- PropTypes
- Synthetic Events

<br/>

A full list of missing or altered features can be found here: <InlineLink

text="Preact differences to react"/>.
<br/>

So check your application for these features and verify if everything is working after building and before deploying to production.

<br/>

## Implementation

To get started if you haven't already, create a `next.config.js` and include the following code:

<br/>

```js:
module.exports = {
  webpack: (config, { dev, isServer }) => {
    // Replace React with Preact only in client production build
    if (!dev && !isServer) {
      Object.assign(config.resolve.alias, {
        react: 'preact/compat',
        'react-dom/test-utils': 'preact/test-utils',
        'react-dom': 'preact/compat',
      });
    }

    return config;
  },
};
```
