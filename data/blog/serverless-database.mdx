### What is Planetscale

Based on Vitess, PlanetScale is a new Database as a service platform that allows you to start up a database in seconds,
without having to worry at all about connection management. They offer neat stuff such as branching,
deployment requests (similar to git) and automatic scaling.
<br/>

### Setting up the database

But First you should create an account at PlanetScale: <InlineLink href="https://auth.planetscale.com/sign-in"
text="PlanetScale Sign-up"/>

Now you should see the dashboard of the application.
Click the button "Create database" and enter a database name of your choice.
