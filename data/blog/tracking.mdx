### Why you should consider using alternatives to GA

Google Analytics with it's 85% (<InlineLink href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/history_overview/traffic_analysis" text="Source"/>) market share is the most widely used web analytics tool out there.
It offers a wide spectrum of functionality for free. There are some major drawbacks like:

- No privacy by design
- Large script size (compared to competitors)
- To complex for small sites
- Closed source
- data sampling

Run by the largest adtech company, GA is well known to share data with advertising and other third-party companies.
Google monetizes data, collected by your own site in order to analyse personal and behavioral trends across all business areas.

I know it's overused, but it still applies:
 > As Tim O’Reilly said: "If you're not paying for the product, you are the product."

There is even a <InlineLink href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Analytics"
text="Wikipedia article"/> about scandals caused by Google Analytics. Furthermore several countries like France
and Austria have found, that the use of GA is a breach of General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). In the case of
an austrian website called NetDoktor, european regulators are not okay with companies sending not properly protected
data to servers located oversees (<InlineLink href="https://www.wired.com/story/google-analytics-europe-austria-privacy-shield/" text="Source"/>).

A few weeks ago, the European Parliament’s Covid-19 testing website had also breached
GDPR by using cookies from Google Analytics. IMHO it's a matter of time until the EU brings strong regulations related to
tools from Big Tech.

### Here are some alternatives

There are some really great alternatives out there with lots of neat features. The ones I will write about are
called <InlineLink href="https://splitbee.io/" text="Splittbee"/>, <InlineLink href="https://usefathom.com/" text="Fathom"/> and <InlineLink href="https://plausible.io/" text="Plausible"/>.

All three come with:

- Privacy-friendliness
- GDPR compliance with data stored in the EU
- Small script sizes
- Ad-Block immunity
- Complete Data ownership


Mostly used blockers like uBlock don't have scripts such as those three on their blacklists. With Plausible and Fathom you have the
option to self-host your analytics application and proxy the tracking script from your domain name.

I personally use <InlineLink href="https://plausible.io/" text="Plausible"/> at the moment, because I like the self-hosted
version and keeping my own data. Here is a very good example of installing Plausible Analytics on a remote server (digital ocean) using
docker: <InlineLink href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-plausible-analytics-on-ubuntu-20-04" text="Install Plausible on Ubuntu" />

If you don't want to self-host your tool, you can use Splitbee for free (for small sites with little traffic) and Plausible/Fathom for 9$/14$. The cloud hosted plans
does not require the use of cookies on all three alternatives.

So give it a try and stop exploiting visitor data for Big Tech profits. Please.
